  Sources of the MacMETH Modula-2 Compiler  ========================================  Each of the 2 folders "MacC2.6" and "MacC3.3" contains a Modula-2  Single-Pass Compiler for the Apple Macintosh. Included within a  folder are a set of definition and implementation modules and one  main module (Compile.MOD), the later being the main program of  the compiler. The following table list the most important modules  of the compiler, the module names and the associated functions:     name               function     ----               --------     Compile.MOD        Parser and Compiler's main program     M2Rx.xxx           Reference/Symbol-File Generator     M2Tx.xxx           Table Handler     M2Ex.xxx           Expression Evaluation     M2Cx.xxx           Control structures handling     M2Hx.xxx           (Hardware) Codegenerator     M2Lx.xxx           (Link-) Object-File Generator     M2Sx.xxx           Scanner     M2Dx.xxx           Data Definitions     ....               ....           Each folder contains not only a codegenerator for the MC68000, but  also an additional codegenerator for the MC68040 processor.  Commandfiles for the bootstrap of the MC68000 compiler and/or the  self-compilation of the MC68040 compiler are included as well.  All sources are compilable and executable on top of MacMETH 3.2.    Folder "MacC2.6" :  ---------------   contains the sources of the MacMETH Modula-2 Compiler Version 2.6.  This version implements Modula-2 as described in the book  N. Wirth, "Programming in Modula-2", Third corrected Edition,  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg New York Tokyo 1985.  For differences from the report in the Third corrected Edition  and some restrictions see in the MacMETH 3.2 User Manual, 1992.  Folder "MacC3.3" :  ---------------   contains the sources of the MacMETH Modula-2 Compiler Version 3.3,  which corresponds to the implementation described in the book  N. Wirth, "Programming in Modula-2", Fourth Edition,  Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg New York Tokyo 1988.  For differences from the report in the Fourth Edition and some  restrictions see in the MacMETH 3.2 User Manual, 1992, and  especially in Appendix B.  Authors of the Modula-2 Compiler  ================================  Niklaus Wirth    	(NW)  Juerg Gutknecht   (JG)  Werner Heiz      	(WH)  Hermann Seiler    (HS)  Copyright  =========  Copyright 1992 Departement Informatik,  Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zuerich,  ETH Zentrum, CH-8092 Zuerich, Switzerland.  This software is subject to copyright.  Please read the copyright notice in the file "copyright"!
